I conducted customer needs analysis, market segmentation (demographic, psychographic, geographic, and behavioral), and defined the company vision, product vision, and value propositions. The work also included crafting a product strategy with personalization and contextual recommendations, adaptive streaming, UI/UX optimization, and a roadmap from analytics foundations to engagement features, supported by a go-to-market strategy and Business Model Canvas. Finally, I translated these insights into OKRs that focus on accessibility, personalization, retention, and monetization, making the case for Vidio.com as a leading one-stop OTT entertainment hub in Indonesia.",

    description: "This project involved designing a comprehensive user research plan for Streamify, aimed at uncovering key challenges and behaviors that impact user engagement and retention. The research objectives focused on understanding why users cancel subscriptions, fail to complete viewing sessions, or no longer use promotional vouchers. The study targeted three respondent groups: active users with low engagement, churned users who unsubscribed within the last three months, and users who previously utilized promotions but have since stopped. To guide the research, I developed structured interview scripts that included an introduction, optional identity questions, warm-up questions about user expectations and content discovery habits, as well as core questions exploring subscription satisfaction, content preferences, promotional relevance, payment experiences, and technical usability. The framework also included an optional closing script to ensure a positive user experience. Overall, this research plan demonstrates a user-centric approach to identifying pain points and generating actionable insights for improving product features, promotional strategies, and overall platform experience.",

    description: "In this project, I conducted a comprehensive product analysis on the low adoption of the wishlist feature in an e-commerce platform using the SCQA framework, issue tree, user insights, and the 5 Whys method. The study revealed that users had limited understanding of the feature's purpose and benefits, partly due to poor onboarding, low visibility, unintuitive icon design, and inaccessible placement within the app. Many users perceived the wishlist as a simple bookmark or preferred alternatives like screenshots and saved links, leading to low engagement and minimal impact on purchase conversions. From these findings, I proposed solutions such as improved onboarding through contextual pop-ups, more strategic feature placement, clearer visual cues, and the introduction of notifications for stock updates or price drops to enhance user awareness, accessibility, and overall feature adoption.",

    description: "I collaborated on a case study focused on enhancing Shopee's Favorite feature to increase user engagement. Through the ideation process, including Crazy 8s and HMW (How Might We) framing, we identified that many users add items to their favorites but rarely revisit them due to limited visibility, lack of notifications, and low awareness of the feature. Our solutions explored timely and relevant notifications, gamification to make browsing more engaging, a dashboard for easier access, search functionality within favorites, and incentives such as flash sales and daily missions. This project highlighted our ability to combine user insights, creative ideation, and product thinking to design practical features that drive user retention and encourage timely purchases.",

I began by performing quantitative data analysis, uncovering that Premium users had significantly higher average watch times than Standard and Basic tiers, with engagement also influenced by notification frequency and daily content consumption. I then developed qualitative insights through interview preparation, documentation, and thematic categorization, identifying key issues such as frustration over sudden paywall transitions, lack of personalized notifications, and limited content variety. By synthesizing both data types, I identified the root cause and reframed it into a structured problem statement supported by user pain points. Using tools like issue trees and affinity diagrams, I proposed actionable recommendations including clearer messaging for free-tier users, improved personalization of notifications, UI/UX enhancements, and strategies to encourage upgrades, forming a holistic analysis that bridges data insights with user-centric solutions.",

Through data analysis, user interviews, and behavioral insights, the project identified key issues such as lower engagement compared to Premium users and frustration with unclear content access policies. The proposed solutions included personalized notifications, transparent communication regarding premium content, and a free Premium trial strategy, supported by UI/UX improvements and targeted promotions. By addressing these challenges, the project aimed to boost daily watch duration, enhance user satisfaction, reduce churn, and drive subscription upgrades, ultimately aligning user needs with business objectives in a structured, data-driven approach.",

The focus was on gathering insights from different types of users (extreme, semi-extreme, and non-extreme) in order to better understand their motivations, challenges, and expectations when using food delivery apps. Through this structured testing, the prototype revealed key usability issues such as confusing navigation, oversized images requiring excessive scrolling, lack of food variety, and unclear homepage content organization.

Through data analysis, engineering insights, and user behavior mapping, I investigated the root causes and validated assumptions using clickstream data, API response checks, and segmentation by user type and device. Based on these findings, I proposed solutions including a 30-minute price lock, 2-hour stock lock with UI timer, earlier shipping fee estimation, and optimized checkout performance. The outcome was documented in a requirement specification titled Smart Checkout Stabilizer, designed to enhance user confidence, reduce drop-offs, and improve overall purchase conversion.",
